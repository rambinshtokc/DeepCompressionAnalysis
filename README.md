# Performance Analysis of VAE and Autoencoder Architectures

## Overview

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and traditional Autoencoders (AE) to evaluate their performance in image compression tasks. The study focuses on the impact of various model parameters and configurations on key performance metrics, including reconstruction quality, compression ratio, and noise robustness.

## Abstract

This study investigates how different configurations and parameters affect the performance of image compression using deep neural network architectures, specifically Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and traditional Autoencoders. Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) are used to assess reconstruction quality. Various aspects including regularization techniques (L1, L2), noise robustness, and more are analyzed. The findings aim to guide the optimization of VAE and AE architectures for improved image compression.

## Introduction

Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders are essential tools for dimension reduction and image compression. Autoencoders, introduced in 2006, learn efficient data representations by compressing input data into a latent space and reconstructing it. VAEs, introduced in 2013, enhance this approach with probabilistic elements, enabling the generation of new data samples. This project analyzes the impact of various parameters on these models' performance, with a focus on reconstruction quality and compression efficiency.

## Discussion on Noise Robustness

### Autoencoder

The Autoencoder exhibited a decline in reconstruction quality with increasing noise levels. The MSE increased from `0.012` to `0.020` as Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of `0.1` was added. Regularization techniques improved the robustness to noise, particularly Elastic Net, which provided a more stable reconstruction quality under noisy conditions.

### Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

The VAE demonstrated better robustness to noise compared to the Autoencoder. The MSE increase with noise was less pronounced, going from `0.015` to `0.018` under similar conditions. The probabilistic nature of the VAE contributed to better handling of noisy inputs. Regularization further enhanced this robustness, with Elastic Net showing the most significant improvement.

## Conclusion

Both VAE and AE architectures exhibit strengths and limitations in image compression tasks. The VAE shows a notable advantage in noise robustness and generates higher-quality reconstructions under challenging conditions. Regularization techniques, especially Elastic Net, significantly impact both models' performance, improving their reconstruction quality and robustness.

**Future Work**: Further studies could explore the impact of different types of noise and investigate the effectiveness of advanced regularization techniques.
