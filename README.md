Face Image Compression Using Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders
Overview
This project explores the effectiveness of Autoencoders (AEs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) in compressing face images. The study focuses on evaluating various regularization techniques to determine the best approach for different image conditions, such as clean and noisy datasets.

Project Objectives
Evaluate Performance: Compare the performance of AEs and VAEs in compressing face images.
Assess Regularization Techniques: Investigate the impact of L1, L2, and combined regularization methods on the compression quality, particularly under clean and noisy conditions.
Enhance Robustness: Identify strategies that improve the robustness of compressed images against noise.
Key Findings
Compression Quality: Autoencoders (AEs) generally provided superior compression quality compared to Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for face images.
Regularization Impact:
L2 Regularization and No Regularization performed best with clean images, maintaining high-quality reconstruction.
L1 Regularization and L1 + L2 Regularization improved robustness and performance in noisy conditions, offering better resilience against noise.
Methodology
Dataset: The project utilized a dataset of face images for training and evaluation.
Model Architectures:
Autoencoder (AE): A standard Autoencoder architecture with no stochastic component.
Variational Autoencoder (VAE): An architecture that introduces a probabilistic element, enabling more diverse latent space exploration.
Regularization Techniques:
L1 Regularization: Encourages sparsity by penalizing the absolute value of weights.
L2 Regularization: Penalizes the square of weights, discouraging large weight values.
L1 + L2 Regularization (Elastic Net): Combines L1 and L2 regularization to balance sparsity and small weights.
Evaluation Metrics: The models were assessed based on reconstruction quality, particularly focusing on how well they preserved image details under various regularization schemes.
